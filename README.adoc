:toc:
:private_repo_name: terraform-states
:private_repo_url: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/{private_repo_name}

This repository hosts the infrastructure-as-code definition for all the link:https://www.oracle.com/cloud/[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure] resources for the link:https://www.jenkins.io/projects/infrastructure/[Jenkins Infrastructure Project].

== Requirements

* An Oracle Cloud account with the administration permissions on the tenant jenkins infra.
* The requirements (of the shared tools) listed at link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/shared-tools/tree/main/terraform#requirements[shared-tools/terraform#requirements]
* The link:https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/azurerm.html[Terraform Azure Bucket] on a local file named `backend-config`:
** The content can be retrieved from the outputs of the link:{private_repo_url}[(private) repository {private_repo_name}]
** This file (`backend-config`) is git-ignored

* The git command line to allow cloning the repository and its submodule link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/shared-tools[shared-tools]
** This repository has submodules. Once you cloned the repository, execute the following command to obtain the shared tools:

[source,bash]
----
git submodule update --init --recursive
----

== HowTo

IMPORTANT: Don't blindly execute the terraform code located in this repository on your own account as it may lead your account bill to significantly increase.

Once you've fulfilled the <<Requirements>>, you may execute any command from https://github.com/jenkins-infra/shared-tools/blob/main/terraform/README.adoc#available-commands by adding the correct flag `--directory` pointing to `.shared-tools/terraform/`:

[source,bash]
----
make --directory=.shared-tools/terraform help
make --directory=.shared-tools/terraform lint
# ...
----


A usual change to this repository looks like the following:

* Fork the repository and clone it locally
* Follow the <<Requirements>> steps to obtain the shared tools
* Start by running a full `make --directory=.shared-tools/terraform validate` command to ensure that you work on a sane base (should generate a report TXT file with no changes to be applied)
* Edit the Terraform project files
* Run the command `make --directory=.shared-tools/terraform validate` again to ensure that your changes are OK
* Commit, push and open a pull request to let the Jenkins pipeline run the test + plan (as per https://github.com/jenkins-infra/shared-tools/blob/main/terraform/README.adoc#jenkins-pipeline)
